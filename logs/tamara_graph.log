Keep responses focused and relevant to TAMARA\n        \n        Use ONLY the following context to answer the question:\n        \nAn ongoing run can be paused &amp; resumed at any time. Bear in mind  that  this  can  affect  your nanoparticle sample quality.\n\nRun data explanation: Volume  of  Mix : Total  output volume produced Time left: Remaining time at the end of a run. Should be 0 if the run has not been interrupted. Volume of liquid Left in Manifold :  Remaining  volume  of liquid in the reservoir : Provide  info  on  whether  the be remain\n\n| Standard procedure: New run ...........................................................................................................................25                                     |                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\nQuick Launch: When clicking on the saved run name, you directly access the run load screen (1.2).\n\nSaved runs management: Edit/reorder saved  run  settings  list,  or  launch  a  past run.\n\n## 3.2 Save run management\n\nUse this tool to manage and/or launch a saved run.\n\nSaves management: Click on a saved run. Using the bottom icons: bring to top, bring up, bring down or delete it.\n\n## Volume of cleaning solution\n\nThe suggested volume of cleaning solution corresponds to  the  maximum  amount  of liquids the reservoir can hold. You can potentially use less to save solvent.\n\n## Successful clean\n\nAlways make sure that liquid is coming out through the chip outlet! If not, stop your run and change chip or check your pressure supply.\n\n## Load / Save mode\n\n## 3.1 Access saved runs\n\nFrom the home page, you can either launch a quick run or access the save options.\n\n| System maintenance ...................................................................................................................................................47                      |                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\n## Quick save\n\nYou can quickly save your run condition  by  hitting  the  save button. Give it a name, and you will  be  able  to  access  it  from the  home  page  or  the  saved run management menu (3.2)\n\n## Quick overview of the run settings\n\nNever  fill  the  reservoir with  more  liquid  than the indicated maximum volume. Always maintain a minimum distance of 1cm between the liquid surface and the top of the reservoir.\n\n## Clean 5.\n\n- Press on the play button to launch your clean\n- Wait until all the cleaning solution has been injected\n- Once done, press on next to go back to the home page\n\nAfter cleaning your system, always ensure it is perfectly dry before launching a new run. You can run an extra purge to ensure it.\n\nNote that when a clogging occurs in a chip, the contents of one reservoir may enter another, leading to contamination. In extreme situations, the fluids could even flow back towards the controller. To mitigate this, a set of internal safety filters is installed to stop any reverse flow from progressing further. This reversed flow is directed into a safety collector located at the module\'s back, which you should empty.\n\n## I observe bubble at the start or at the end of my run, is that normal ?\n\n## 1.3 Run in progress\n\nWait until your run is completed\n\nPause (Left  most  button):  Put  your  synthesis on hold/resume it.\n\nStop (Right most button): Finish your synthesis and go to the summary page.\n\n## 1.4 Run completed\n\nOnce your run is completed, you should access  this  page.  If  not,  this  means  that your run has failed and you should follow the suggestions on the screen.\n\nReport: Get access to an advanced report with more information on your run conditions\n\nTo clean the chip, gasket and reservoir, please follow the instruction of the clean section presented  above.  For  the  gasket,  you  can  clean  it  with  any  silicone-compatible  cleaning solution (NaOH, RNAseAway, Ethanolâ€¦)\n\n## How often should I clean the chip?\n\nPlease  clean  the  chip  and  the  reservoir  after  each  run  to  avoid  cross  contamination  and agglomeration.\n\nAfter every clean, please make sure the chip is perfectly dry before launching a new run.\n\nTo minimize this, make sure that no bubble is present is your reservoir when launching a run. When working with small volumes, you can "tap" the reservoir remove bubbles stucked in the fluidic path.\n\n## I observe cross contamination during my run. How did that happen ?\n\nCross contamination can occur if the cleaning process has not been properly carried out.\n\nShould you want to make sure no cross contamination happens, use one chip per experiment and thoroughly autoclave your reservoirs.\n\nDone: Finish your run and go back to the home page\n\n## Setting values\n\nBoundary  values  are  variable and will  depend  on  the  hardware parameters  (i.e  reservoir  size, maximum pressureâ€¦). The right hand  side  of  your  screen  will turn purple should any of your input values outside this range.\n\n## Quick save\n\n## Purge 3.\n\n- Purge the reservoir from any remaining liquids in the system by applying pressure to it. Launch it by pressing on the play button .\n- Once the purge is completed, go to the next step by clicking on next .\n\nYou can pause the purge at any time by pressing the yellow play button\n\n## Load cleaning solution 4.\n\nQuick launch: Click on a saved run, then click  on  the  load  button  to  directly  go to the run load screen (1.2) and run your sample.\n\nHow to make your saved run parameters  appear  on  the home page? Bring your saved run parameters  to  the  top  5  of the list to make them appear on the home page.\n\n## Menu\n\n## 4.1 Menu Home\n\nBy clicking on the items on the menu, you can access all the advanced options of the TAMARA Controller module.\n\n## 4.2 Run history\n\nREMINDER : Please note that while we allow chip cleaning, cleaning the chip for reuse may not be possible with every sample, as chip reusability can vary significantly depending on factors such as composition, concentration and volume. To maximize chip reusability, follow each step of the process carefully. Always remember to finish your procedure with a purge to ensure the chip is dry for your next run.\n        \n        Base your answers solely on the provided context.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': 'run', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Parameters sent to PLC.
