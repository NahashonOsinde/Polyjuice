## Liposomes vs Lipid Nanoparticles as vehicles for delivery applications

There  exist  several  kinds  of  lipid-based  nanoparticles  (LBNPs)  that  are  fabricated  for  delivering  small molecules, oligonucleotides, and peptide/protein drugs, among which are widely used Liposomes and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) [A2, B1]. Although mistaken for LNPs, Liposomes are only close cousins of them, rather than ancestors, and present few differences in structure, properties, and hence applications.

In  this  article,  a  detailed  description of Liposomes and LNPs, with their respective applications will be provided. In addition, the main differences between the two nanocarriers, as well as the advantages and drawbacks of each will be highlighted.

## What are Liposomes?

Liposomes, sometimes referred to as vesicles, are aggregates composed of a unilamellar (single bilayer) or  multilamellar  (concentrical  bilayers)  shell  made  from  amphipathic  (amphiphilic)  molecules  which encloses an aqueous core. Those amphipathic molecules were serendipitously discovered in 1964, and consist of hydrophilic, polar head groups and hydrophobic, non-polar tails, and comprise primarily natural phospholipids (e.g., phosphatidylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), phosphatidylglycerols (PGs), and phosphatidylserines (PSs)) [B1, B2, B3, B5, C1]. They possess diameters that can range from tens of nanometers up to hundreds of micrometers [B3, C2]. Liposome bilayers may also contain other constituents,  such  as  cholesterol,  that  act  as  stabilizers,  improving  membrane  fluidity  and  reducing membrane  permeability  [B1,  B3].  Accordingly,  cargos  of  appropriate  sizes  can  be  enclosed  within liposomes' aqueous compartment s (if hydrophilic) or even within their lipid bilayer (if lipophilic) [C2]. This unique structure allows liposomes to deliver multiple cargos simultaneously [C1].

Liposomes  can  be  categorized  depending  on  their  applications  or  structure,  the  latter  being  more commonly used [A2, B5, B6, B7]. Accordingly, liposomes can be subdivided into different types depending on their size and lamellarity [Figure 1], and are generally clustered as such:

- -Unilamellar vesicles (ULV): One single lipid bilayer forming one single vesicle.
- o Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV).
- o Medium unilamellar vesicles (MUV).
- o Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV).
- o Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV), are distinguished from the above as having a diameter in the microns scale.
- -Oligolamellar vesicles (OLV): few concentric bilayers.
- -Multilamellar vesicles (MLV): many concentric bilayers forming an onion-like multilayer structure.
- -Multivesicular vesicles (MVV): multiple small vesicles enclosed within a larger vesicle.

Each  of  these  formulations  offers  different  characteristics  in  terms  of  drug  loading  capacity,  release profile, and stability. Note that size range classification can vary from one source to the other but are typically in the same order of magnitude.

## Applications of Liposomes

Liposome research and development has led to multiple use cases in the biomedical field, with Doxil -a PEGylated MLV-carrying chemotherapy cancer drug -being the first to be FDA-approved in 1995 [B1]. Progressively, the advances in formulation and surface functionalization (i.e., PEGylation) enhanced the efficiencies of drug delivery and broadened the application areas of liposomes, many of which are already approved with others awaiting approval. This mostly includes cancer treatments, but also incorporates anti-inflammatory,  antibiotic,  antifungal,  anesthetic,  and  analgesic  drugs,  in  addition  to  gene  and immuno-suppressant  delivery  [A2,  B6,  B7,  C2].  Moreover,  liposomes  have  also  been  used  for  other applications, such as the cosmetics, biosensing, food, and farming industries [B3, B6].

## What are LNPs?

The term Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) started to be used in 1990, after the first laboratory invention and patent filled in 1991, at the time when the era of nanoscience and nanotechnology began [B7]. This term sometimes  mistakenly  incorporates  other  nanocarriers  such  as  Solid  Lipid  Nanoparticles  (SLNs)  and Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLCs), which also fall under the umbrella of LBNPs, but differ from LNPs.

In  terms  of  structure,  LNP s'  main  distinction  from  other  LBNPs ,  especially  Liposomes,  is  within  the structure, having a core that normally encompasses reverse micellar structures, and walled by a lipid monolayer shell [B1]. The monolayer is generally composed of phospholipids, cholesterol -for increased structural stability and adjusting fluidity, enhancing circulation time, in addition to PEGylation -which enhances stability and provides a 'stealth -effect', providing higher circulation half -life too, and ionizable cationic lipids -which are also present in the micellar structure and permit the efficient encapsulation of nucleic acids, making LNPs widely recognized for non-viral gene delivery [B1, C2]. Furthermore, these LNPs are used to deliver most types of nucleic acids (RNA, DNA, peptidesâ€¦) [B1].

## Applications of Lipid Nanoparticles

The increased need for effective LBNP systems for gene therapy and nucleic acid delivery pushed the development of LNPs forward, especially with the FDA approval of Onpattro (patisiran) in 2018 [B1, C1]. In fact, the characteristic properties of LNPs allow them to be good candidates for carrying and delivering nucleic acid, for potential DNA &amp; RNA-based treatments. Hence, the applications of LNPs as nanocarriers depend on the type of cargo within.

- -siRNA LNPs: small interfering RNA (siRNA) targets typically messenger RNA (mRNA) and inhibit the expression of fragments that can cause diseases by specifically preventing protein translation [B1, B8]. This is referred to as an RNA interference (RNAi) therapy, and it is the case of Onpattro, which targets  the  mRNA  that  encodes  for  transthyretin  (TTR)  protein  which  is  involved  in  the development of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis), leading to a peripheral nerve disease [B1, B7]. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is also being investigated as a potential therapeutic target for siRNA LNPs, widening the use-cases of LNPs [B1].
- -mRNA LNPs: In contrast to siRNA, mRNA induces protein expression. In diseases where genetic mutations cause issues with protein synthesis or for the production of neutralizing antibodies, mRNA-based therapies can be used to restore normal cellular function [B1]. This was the case of the two COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics (Comirnaty BNT162b2 and Spikevax mRNA-1273, respectively) to induce an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus  [A2,  B1,  B4,  B7,  B8].  Following  the  advances  in  the  mRNA-based  COVID-19 vaccine, multiple clinical trials are presently underway using LNP-formulated mRNA drugs and vaccines [A2]. Moreover, mRNA vaccines could be potentially used for cancer immunotherapy or even  gene  editing  via  the  CRISPR/Cas9  system  [B1].  mRNA  LNPs  are  promising  despite  being relatively new in terms of development and very recent in terms of approval [B7].

Other  genetic  therapeutics  are  also  being  investigated,  such  as  microRNA  (miRNA),  single-guide  RNA (sgRNA)-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 system [B8], and plasmid DNA pDNA [B1].

## What are the main similarities and differences between Liposomes and Lipid nanoparticles?

Falling under the umbrella of LBNPs, both Liposomes and LNPs are lipidic structures that can be used as nanocarriers for different types of cargo and therapeutics [C1, C2]. They both consist of lipidic shells that protect their cargo, especially those that cannot be delivered in traditional drug delivery systems (DDS). In addition, these two nanostructures are biocompatible and biodegradable, can be PEGylated to permit longer circulation times, benefit from the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect for passive targeting (depending on their size) mainly for cancer, and can be even functionalized to permit active targeting of therapeutic sites. However, Liposomes and LNPs have important differences, which are listed in Table 1 below:

| Main Differences              | Liposomes                                      | Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs)                           |

| Structure complexity [C1, C2] | Relatively simple                              | Relatively complex                                   |
| Stability*                    | Rather less stable                             | Rather more stable                                   |

## Advantages and drawbacks of Liposomes vs LNPs

This final section presents the advantages and drawbacks of both liposomes and LNPs. It is crucial to note however  that  advantages  and  drawbacks  can  highly  depend  on  the  drug  encapsulated  and  the administrative route (oral, transdermal, intravenous, etc.).

## Liposomes

Heretofore, the research involving the encapsulation of drugs within liposomes has shown measurable advantages  in  terms  of  better  protection  and  sustained  release  of  the  drugs  [C2],  in  addition  to  the possibility of carrying multiple hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic drugs at once [B5, B6]. The PEGylation of liposomes also improved further their circulation times invivo, providing a 'stealth effect ' [B2].

Yet, those vesicles faced multiple challenges limiting their success rates. It has been found that the size of liposomes  has  a  great  impact  on  encapsulation  efficiency  [B7]  and  ADME  (absorption,  distribution, metabolism, and excretion) pharmacokinetics, specifically in terms of distribution and clearance [B5]. For instance, it was identified that liposomes' size dictates whether they can enter or exit fenestrated vessels in the liver endothelium or tumor microenvironment [B5]. Also, apart from the effect of size on the speed of  activation  of  the  Mononuclear Phagocyte System (MPS), large liposomes may not be able to leave capillaries that perfuse vital tissues such as the lung, heart, and kidney or may be retained for longer times once inside tissue with narrow pores [B5]. In other instances, liposomes of certain size ranges can escape through  discontinuous  leaky  capillaries  in  the  vicinity  of  some  organs,  reducing  the  specificity  and increasing the toxicity of those DDS [B5]. Other limitations of liposomes include their low physical and chemical stability, low solubility in aqueous solutions, and short half-life in the body environment. Drug leakage from liposomes has also been reported in multiple instances [A2, B6]. Besides, cationic liposomes -which were developed to carry and transport negatively charged nucleic acids -have shown a lot of stability and toxicity problems [B2, B6, B7]. These cationic liposomes promised since the early 90s the possibility of incorporating DNA as cargo. However, they were found to be toxic to macrophages, and reduced their secretion of important immune modulators as well [B6].

## LNPs

The discovery of LNPs is expected to resolve many of the challenges faced with liposomes, especially in terms of gene therapy. As mentioned above, LNPs ' lipid structure generally consists of ionizable lipids, which are positively charged at acidic pH (to condense RNAs), and neutral at physiological pH [A2]. This permitted the reduction of toxicity -a characteristic drawback of cationic liposomes [B4, B8]. In addition, those ionizable lipids enhance encapsulation stability and efficiency of RNAs [B1, C1, C2] and offer overall higher bioavailability and lower cytotoxicity [C1], turning them into the most promising nanocarriers for nucleic acids. Furthermore, LNPs have been optimized to enable better cell uptake and cargo release, permitting enhanced delivery [B1, B4].

Nevertheless, the research on LNPs is faced with multiple challenges, mainly related to the choice of cationic lipid and size, as it can influence the performance of in-vivo release. As such, a compromise in size should be found to balance cell targeting and intake efficiency with fabrication efficiency as well as cytotoxicity prevention. Finally, before any clinical trials are conducted, a thorough comprehension of all the significant phases of the LNPs' ADME pharmacokinetics and course within the body, beginning from the site of administration to the discharge of the cargo, is highly necessary [B4].

## Conclusion

At first glance, it appears that Liposomes and LNPs are close cousins, which share a lot of similarities in terms of size, functionalization possibilities, composition, and synthesis method. However, when giving them a closer look, it appears that both are used in totally different contexts: Liposomes thanks to their simplicity have very quickly become a widespread tool for the encapsulation and delivery of hydrophilic and small hydrophobic drugs, while LNPs, which are much more complex, offer a unique tool for the delivery of nucleic acid material directly inside cells with high efficiency.
