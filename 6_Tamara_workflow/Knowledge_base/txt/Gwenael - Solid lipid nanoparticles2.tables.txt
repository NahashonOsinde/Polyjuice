## Introduction to solid lipid nanoparticles

Over the last few decades, the significance of lipid-based nanoparticles (LBNs) development has greatly increased in the realm of biomedicine. Among these LBNs, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are part of the most promising ones, due to their properties. Their development started to  overcome  some  limitations  met  with  traditional  nanocarriers  like  liposomes,  such  as physicochemical stability or poor encapsulation efficiency. In fact, SNLs benefit from unique properties such as large surface area, low toxicity and can encapsulate both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs. Lipophilic drugs are encapsulated between fatty acid chains, between the lipid  layers  and  inside  crystal  imperfections,  while  low  doses  of  hydrophilic  drugs  can  be incorporated in the lipid core. These carriers are composed of a crystalline lipid core stabilized by a surfactant and co-surfactant shell and their encapsulation properties differ depending on the nature of lipids and surfactants used. This makes them tailorable to specific applications, like controlled release mechanism for drug delivery or RNA encapsulation.

## SLNs formulation

Despite the differences between SLNs and other lipid-based nanoparticles, the mechanism responsible for their formation is similar.

A large variety of lipids can be used to formulate SLNs : switching a lipid for another one or changing the relative proportion of the components changes the crystal structure of the lipid matrix. Mono-, di-, and triglycerides, fatty acids, steroids and waxes are the lipids that are usually used when it comes to formulating SLNs, due to their low toxicity and their melting point above the body temperature, to maintain the solid core structure in vivo .

A crucial parameter of the lipid solidification that requires specific attention is the possible polymorphic  transformation  that  can  occur  after  the  SLNs  production.  By  being  able  to crystallize in different possible crystal species during their production, the SLNs can then go through  polymorphic  transitions  to  reassemble  into  more  stable  structures,  leading  to possible  drug  ejection  and  lowering  drug  entrapment  efficiency.  In  fact,  a  higher  ordered crystal lattice leads to less imperfections, thus leading to a lower drug encapsulation capacity.

The  selection  of  the  adequate  surfactants  arises  from  the  lipid,  since  a  physicochemical compatibility is required between them. A combination of surfactants or the addition of cosurfactants is usually used to prevent particle coalescence. Also, this choice depends on the administration route, either parenteral or oral. Amphiphilic molecules such as monoglycerides of long-chain fatty acids, or phospholipids can be used as surfactants.

## SLNs production methods

Different methods can be used to obtain these emulsions : high energy methods like high shear homogenization or ultrasound homogenization, low energy methods like microemulsion  and  microchannels,  and    solvent-based  methods  like  solvent  evaporation. Among these methods, the microemulsion presents outstanding advantages compared to the others : microemulsion is quite an easy method that doesn't require neither high energy nor specific equipment. Moreover, by not using organic solvents while using this technique, the produced SLNs' toxicity is lessened. It is currently one of the scale -up methods studied to start a future commercialization of SLNs, as well as high-pressure homogenization and microchannels. However, the major drawback of the microemulsion method is its poor size control over the produced SLNs.

## Use of SLNs

LBNs  started  being  developed  to  overcome  important  issues  in  the  biomedical  realm, especially  for  cancer  treatment.  Due  to  their  high  toxicity  and  their  low  biodistribution, molecules commonly used for chemotherapy need encapsulation to increase their half-life in the body. Moreover, the development of these nanocarriers enables specific cells targeting with PEG-coated and ligand-coated LBNs, leading to a reduced toxicity for healthy cells.

Among the different LBNs, SLNs are part of the most promising ones for anticancer drugs encapsulation. SLNs' lipophilic structure increases permeability through the intestinal wall, allowing possible oral administration. Also, SLNs' enhanced penetration th rough skin has also been studied, making them possible carriers for drug delivery to melanomas directly through the skin. Coating SLNs with PEG and specific antibodies enhances even more these targeting properties.

In addition to their tumor targeting properties and the introduction of new administration routes for cancer treatment, the use of SLNs for delivering a wide variety of drugs is being studied, due to their drug release mechanism. In fact, the drug present on the SLNs' surface show  immediate  release  effect,  while  the  drug  encapsulated  in  the  lipid  core  won't  be released until the core is degraded, leading to tailorable release mechanisms by making the lipid  core  sensible to temperature, pH etc, which makes SLNs suitable for macromolecules delivery, like mRNA, vitamins or antimicrobial.

## Advantages

SLNs stand out from the other LNPs for different reasons. First, as already mentioned, due to their  structure,  SLNs  can  encapsulate  both  hydrophilic  and  lipophilic  drugs,  but  they  also improve the stability of the pharmaceuticals they carry. By improving the circulation time of the drug in the body and protecting it from degradation better than other LNPs, they enhance the drugs' biodistribution,  as  well  as  allowing  a  targeted  and  controlled  drug  release. Moreover, since most lipids used while formulating SLNs are biodegradable, SLNs benefit from a low toxicity/ high biocompatibility. This high biocompatibility is also enhanced when SLNs are formulated with microemulsion method. In this regard, economical large-scale production can easily be achieved for SLNs. Finally, SLNs encapsulate a wide variety of molecules, from antitumoral drugs to ARN or cosmetical active principal, and can be administered through different routes thanks to their stability, such as oral, parenteral, nasal or ocular.

## Disadvantages

Despite these advantages, SLNs also suffer from a few drawbacks. First, due to their highly crystallized structure, SLNs lack encapsulation volume, leading to poor drug loading capacity, combined with potential drug expulsion during post-production polymeric transitions. SLNs' drug loading capacity are even lower for hydrophilic drugs; however, formulating SLNs with a double  emulsion  method  can  increase  this  hydrophilic  drug  loading  capacity.  The  use  of complex lipids to increase the number of crystal imperfections can also counter this major drawback. Moreover, a new generation of LNPs, called nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), was developed to overcome these limitations, by adding small amounts of liquid lipids into solid lipids, creating general imperfections in the crystal and enhancing drug loading capacity. Lipid  drug  conjugates  (LDCs)  were  also  created  to  counter  the  SLNS'  low  hydrophilic  drug loading capacity by increasing the drug solubility in the lipid melt during the production.

## Conclusion on solid lipid nanoparticles

Due to the numerous applications linked to SLNs and their tailorable properties, the use of microfluidics to produce these nanoparticles seems crucial to precisely control their synthesis.
