LNP synthesis methods: Overview of the manufacturing methods for lipid nanoparticle and liposomes

Numerous methods are available for the synthesis of Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) and more generally for loaded liposomes. The selected technic will depend on the sought characteristics of the synthesized drug (size, encapsulation efficiency, zeta potential), route of administration, development stage of the molecule … The LNP manufacturing methods can be categorized in 3 different classes: highenergy methods, such as high-pressure homogenization, low-energy methods where nanoparticles will precipitate from homogeneous systems, and solvent-based methods.

## Reminder drug development process steps and requirements

To start with, it is important to bear in mind that the requirements of the manufactured LNP vary throughout the drug development process, as described in figure 1.

Volume

The initial steps of the process (screening) require the test of many different LNP (up to several 100s) with different API, lipids mix, synthesis conditions … to find the most optimal one. Due to the very high cost of lipids and API, work with very low volume (100s of µL) is required at that stage. Depending on the chosen methods, the manufacturing time can also be lengthy, which can also make the tests of hundreds of LNPs very painful.

As the process moves forward, the number of LNP formulation shrinks down (generally 10s of the invitro tests and 1 for the Mass production), while the volumes requirements greatly increase, up to 100s of L.

The ideal LNP manufacturing process should allow for the seamless transition from the initial screening phase at low volumes, all the way to the drug mass production process.

## High energy methods for LNP synthesis:

High energy methods are solvent free methods and rely on the generation of high shear stress forces by putting the lipids into harsh conditions (high pressure, high temperature) to achieve LNP size reduction.

The goal of these technics is to provide sufficient energy to the particles in the system to fragment them. The higher the surface tension the more energy should be supplied to the system to break them.

Overall those methods offer the advantage of being already validated by the pharmaceutical industry and available at large scale. However, the high energy needed can lead to lipid or drug alteration. In addition to this, they offer poor control of the manufactured LNP (large size, high dispersity) and poor encapsulation efficiency.

## High pressure homogenization (HPH)

High pressure homogenization (HPH) permits the creation of an emulsion of molten lipids (generally 5-10%), water and surfactants using a high-speed stirrer. The solution is pushed at high speed through small orifices using high pressures (500 to 5000 bar). The high velocities reached by the fluid are accompanied by turbulence, high shear forces and cavitation which allows the formation of organic NPs even at high concentrations.

Two main approaches are available for the LNP synthesis with HPH: high and low homogenization.

## Hot homogenization

In hot homogenization, a drug and lipid mix are brought to a temperature above their melting point.

The mix is then dispersed into a hot surfactant, while maintaining the temperature.  A hot preemulsion is formed, which is then homogenized before being cooled down, allowing the formation of the nanoparticles.

## Cold Homogenization

For cold homogenization, the drug-lipid melt is cooled down to form microparticles. The particles are then dispersed in a cold surfactant to generate a presuspension. The presuspension is then homogenized to break down the particles and form the lipid nanoparticles. This approach permits the work with thermosensitive drugs by minimizing the diffusion of hydrophilic drugs into the waterphase.

## Ultrasonic homogenization

The lipid and drug mix is brought to high temperature (up to 5000 °K) and high temperature (up to 1000 bar) before being exposed to ultrasound. The ultrasound waves will create cavitation phenomena, leading to the formation and collapse of bubbles, and thus the synthesis of LNP.

## Low energy methods for LNP synthesis

In those methods, particle size reduction is triggered by some spontaneous process rather than the energy brought to the system. Generally based on the modification of the curvature of the surfactant modules, those LNP synthesis methods can be classified in 2 categories: thermal and isothermal ones.

Low energy methods are convenient methods as they don't require harsh synthesis condition, however, their main limitation lies in the high amount of surfactant used and poor control of the parameters of the synthesized LNPs.

Note that those processes can sometimes be followed by an extrusion process where the solution is forced through filters with a given pore size for finer size control.

## Microemulsion

Microemulsion methods can be used for the synthesis of most polymeric and lipid nanoparticles. Water-in-oil (w/o) or Oil-in water (o/w) microemulsions are prepared by mixing two non-miscible liquids in presence of surfactants until a stable dispersion is formed. The nucleation and growth of nanoparticles in microemulsions is a complicated process. The most important factor is the water/surfactant ratio to control the phase separation. Submitting the mixture to ultrasound can also be required to provide sufficient energy in the system. Temperature control can also be used to optimize the synthesis condition: cooling help facilitate the rapid crystallization of the lipids, while heating helps with the suspension generation.

However, those microemulsion technics are limited to the production of a few types of organic nanoparticles with a method called microemulsion polymerization, where hydrophobic monomers are polymerized by the addition of an oil soluble initiator.

To manufacture LNP, a two-step process is used: First hot emulsion made of molten lipids, emulsifiers, and water is generated. In the second step, cold water is added to the solution and stirred until precipitation of the lipid phase.

## Supercritical Fluid Methods (SCFs)

SCFs methods have been developed to overcome the limitations in toxicity of the standard methods. Several methods are available, the most popular one being the Supercritical Anti-solvent Method (SAS). A supercritical fluid is passed through the pressurized chamber, while the drug is sprayed on the SCF using a nozzle. LNPs are generated when hydrated with the aqueous solution. The supercritical CO2 is miscible with the organic solvent and acts as an antisolvent to the solute. Therefore, the synthesized LNP is free from solvent.

## Organic Solvent methods

The near totality of the LNP synthesis methods using solvent are based on nanoprecipitation, a complex process dependent on material type and reaction conditions. The underlying principle is mixing an aqueous phase, containing the hydrophilic API or oligonucleotide to be encapsulated, with a water-miscible solvent, containing the lipids.

The decrease in the partial concentration of the solvent when mixed with the aqueous phase will lead to a drop in solubility of the lipids, which will then start to self-assemble and grow to create nanoparticles.

The self-assembly process is divided into 4 steps supersaturation, nucleation, growth, and stabilization or maturation. The physicochemical characteristics of the formulated LNP are highly dependent on the synthesis conditions.

The most important factors are:

- -The faster the mixing, the smaller the synthesized LNP
- -Increasing the concentration of stabilizing agents decreases the size of the manufactured LNP
- -Higher concentration of solute leads to a larger number of nucleic, hence an increase in coalescence events and final size of the LNP
- -Viscosity and temperature play a role but their influence on the manufactured LNP is hard to predict.

The main limitation of the solvent-based methods is the solvent potentially remaining in the final solution. However, the regulatory framework is relatively flexible in terms of ethanol content (up to 0,5% for the FDA), the remaining excess solvent can easily be extracted using centrifugation, Tangential flow filtration, Dialysis…

## Solvent evaporation method

Solvent evaporation methods are very well adapted for the generation of lipid nanoparticle-trapping molecules with low miscibility in water. Those 2 processes are the original methods used for the synthesis of LNP and are still widely in use due to their ease of use. However, due to the poor control of their synthesis condition, the physicochemical properties of the LNP manufactured are nearly random with very low batch-to-batch reproducibility, and very high sample size dispersity...

## Ethanol injection methods

Lipid nanoparticles are prepared by dissolving the lipids in an organic solvent before injecting them into an aqueous solution. After emulsification of the organic phase into the aqueous one, the solvent is evaporated to obtain the nanoparticle.

## Thin film hydration/Bangham methods

Thin film hydration was the first method used by Bangham for the synthesis of the first liposome. Similar to solvent evaporation, the lipids are dissolved into an organic solvent which is removed by evaporation under a vacuum. The film is then hydrated by an aqueous media containing the API, where it swells to self-produce nanoparticles.

## LNP synthesis using microfluidics.

Considering the importance of finely controlling the mixing parameters to obtain homogenous LNP populations and good batch-to-batch reproducibility, the use of microfluidic quickly appeared as an evident solution to synthesize LNP.

Microfluidics is the technology of manipulating small volumes of liquids, down through fL, through micro-channels. At the micrometer scale, fluids behave differently than in everyday life and show laminar flow condition, which permits excellent control of their flow behavior all throughout the synthesis process, as well as provide an increased volume/surface ratio.

The LNP synthesis process using microfluidics is based on nanoprecipitation through the precise and controlled mixing of an water miscible organic solvent -generally ethanol - and an aqueous phase.

Multiple mixing methods using microfluidics are available. The most popular ones are the flow focusing method, the herringbone, the baffle mixer. They all provide different achievable flow rate, efficiency, repeatability, encapsulation efficiency but overall offer better a better trade-off than all the previously mentioned LNP synthesis methods, and are currently considered the state-of-the-art for the LNP synthesis.

## Characterization of the manufactured LNP

Lipid nanoparticles have physico-chemical attributes that need to be precisely controlled all throughout their synthesis process in order to reach the targeted area and achieve the desired effects in the body.

There is no strict regulatory framework for nanomedicines and no quantitative targets are set by the competent authorities, namely the European Medicine's Agency (EMA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).

However, guidelines exist and require a careful characterization of the physico-chemical attributes of the nanomaterials used in a drug formulation.

These attributes include the size of the NPs, the polydispersity index (PDI) associated with their size distribution, their morphology and internal structure as well as their surface charge. Every batch of NPs needs to be properly characterized before proceeding to in vitro or in vivo assays. Quality checks are also needed in large scale production of drug or vaccines based on LNPs.

## LNP Size and distribution characterization

The lipid nanoparticle size is crucial to determine its in vivo release.

Overall, a compromise should be found between decreasing the particle size, which allows for easier absorption to the cell, and the LNP toxicity which increases when the particle size gets too small. Most lipid nanoparticles used are currently in the 50 to 200 nm range, with an optimal around 100 nm for LNP.

The particle size distribution characterization, or 'polydispersity index' (PDI) , defines the size range of lipid nanoparticles. This index is dimensionless and is scaled so that PDI &lt;0.05 are nearly homogeneous, and PDI &gt;0.5 are totally heterogeneous.

Typically, PDI below 0.2 is sought for the population of lipid nanoparticles and can easily be obtained using microfluidics methods.

The synthesized LNPs are generally characterized using optical methods such as dynamic light scattering (DLS) or laser diffraction (LD).

## LNP surface charge -Zeta potential characterization

The Zeta potential provides information on the charge at the surface of the LNP. It helps predict the long-term stability of the formation. In order to avoid aggregation, it is necessary to have a zeta potential value as high as possible in absolute value (| ζ | ≫ 30mV). Indeed, when the latter tends towards 0 (-10 mV ≤ ζ ≤ 10 mV, the inter-particle forces decrease, and the attractive Van der Walls forces become preponderant. Generally, zeta potential values in the order of -30 mV are reported both avoid aggregation and decrease toxicity.

Zeta potential can also be characterized using specific features of a DLS, or laser Doppler electrophoresis.

## LNP surface morphology characterization

Surface morphology is generally characterized using microscopy methods. Most often Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) are used.

Each of the methods offers a specific compromise. TEM provide a 2D image of the sample, and gives access to the internal structure of the LNP with sub nm resolution. AFM instead permits a 3D visualization of the sample, including its surface with no specific sample preparation.

## Load capacity (DL) and Encapsulation Efficiency (EE%)

Both parameters are related to the LNPs ability to efficiently encapsulate the API.

The DL (%) corresponds to the amount of trapped API over the total LNP weight. Instead, the encapsulation efficiency measures the percentage of drug that was successfully encapsulated, thus corresponds to the amount of trapped API over the initial amount in the formulation.

Encapsulation efficiency greatly varies with the synthesis method and can reach above 90% using the most efficient ones, such as microfluidics.
