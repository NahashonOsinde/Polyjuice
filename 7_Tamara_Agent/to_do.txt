# TAMARA Agent - To Do List

## CLEAN_UPS
- Remove unused function `_do_plc_action` (lines 514-530) - defined but never called
- Remove unused variable `ROUTE_HINT` (lines 224-228) - defined but never used
- Remove unused state fields `last_tool_result` and `confirmed` from GraphState - never read or used for logic
- Add missing type hints to internal functions like `_route_intent` and `_handle_input_collection`
- Add constants for hardcoded status codes (2, 3, 4) in route function for better maintainability
- Improve error logging consistency in REPL (use log.error() instead of print for errors)

## NOTES
- These cleanups are safe removals that won't affect functionality
- Keep SystemMessage import for future use
- Logging improvements to be implemented separately

TAMARA Agent - Production TODO List
ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY - Critical Issues
1. State Management & Graph Flow
[ ] Fix Graph State Persistence: Currently the graph resets after each command - need to maintain operation state
[ ] Implement Proper State Machine: Add states like RUNNING, PAUSED, STOPPED, CLEANING, TESTING
[ ] Add State Transitions: Ensure proper flow between states (e.g., can't pause if not running)
[ ] State Validation: Prevent invalid state transitions (e.g., can't start if already running)
2. PLC Address Configuration
[ ] Complete DB_CONFIG for Clean Mode: Currently only has RUN mode addresses
[ ] Complete DB_CONFIG for Pressure Test Mode: Missing pressure test specific variables
[ ] Add Mode-Specific Variables: Different operations may need different PLC variables
[ ] Validate All Addresses: Ensure no address conflicts or out-of-range errors
3. Error Handling & Recovery
[ ] PLC Connection Failures: Handle network timeouts, connection drops
[ ] Command Verification: Add retry logic for failed PLC writes
[ ] State Recovery: Handle cases where PLC state doesn't match agent state
[ ] Graceful Degradation: Continue operation even if some PLC variables fail
ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Important Features
4. Operation Monitoring & Control
[ ] Real-time Status Updates: Poll PLC status periodically during operations
[ ] Progress Tracking: Monitor operation progress (e.g., % complete for cleaning cycles)
[ ] Timeout Handling: Add timeouts for long-running operations
[ ] Emergency Stop: Implement proper E-stop handling and recovery
5. User Experience & Safety
[ ] Operation Confirmation: Require explicit confirmation for critical operations
[ ] Safety Checks: Validate safety conditions before starting operations
[ ] Operation Logging: Log all operations for audit trail
[ ] User Permissions: Different access levels for different operations
6. Data Management
[ ] Operation History: Store and retrieve previous operation parameters
[ ] Parameter Templates: Save/load common parameter sets
[ ] Export/Import: Allow backup and restore of configurations
[ ] Data Validation: Ensure data integrity and consistency
ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY - Nice to Have
7. Advanced Features
[ ] Scheduled Operations: Allow operations to be scheduled
[ ] Batch Processing: Handle multiple operations in sequence
[ ] Remote Monitoring: Web interface or API for remote access
[ ] Notifications: Alert users of operation completion/failures
8. Performance & Optimization
[ ] Connection Pooling: Reuse PLC connections efficiently
[ ] Async Operations: Non-blocking PLC communications
[ ] Caching: Cache frequently accessed PLC data
[ ] Resource Management: Proper cleanup of resources
   TECHNICAL DEBT & MIGRATION
9. Migration from Snap7 to OPC UA
[ ] Research OPC UA Libraries: Evaluate Python OPC UA clients
[ ] Design OPC UA Interface: Plan the OPC UA server structure
[ ] Implement OPC UA Client: Replace snap7 with OPC UA
[ ] Data Mapping: Map current DB variables to OPC UA nodes
[ ] Testing & Validation: Ensure OPC UA implementation works correctly
10. Code Quality & Testing
[ ] Unit Tests: Add comprehensive test coverage
[ ] Integration Tests: Test full PLC communication flows
[ ] Error Simulation: Test error conditions and recovery
[ ] Performance Tests: Measure response times and throughput
[ ] Code Documentation: Add detailed docstrings and comments
ðŸš¨ SECURITY & COMPLIANCE
11. Security Measures
[ ] Authentication: User login and session management
[ ] Authorization: Role-based access control
[ Audit Logging: Track all user actions and system changes
[ ] Input Validation: Prevent injection attacks and invalid inputs
[ ] Network Security: Secure PLC communication channels
12. Compliance & Standards
[ ] Industry Standards: Ensure compliance with relevant standards
[ ] Data Protection: Implement data privacy measures
[ ] Backup & Recovery: Regular backups and disaster recovery
[ ] Change Management: Proper change control procedures
ðŸ“Š MONITORING & MAINTENANCE
13. System Health
[ ] Health Checks: Monitor system status and performance
[ ] Alerting: Proactive notification of issues
[ ] Metrics Collection: Gather performance and usage metrics
[ ] Log Analysis: Tools for analyzing logs and debugging
14. Deployment & Operations
[ ] Installation Scripts: Automated deployment
[ ] Configuration Management: Environment-specific configurations
[ ] Update Procedures: Safe update and rollback procedures
[ ] Backup Procedures: Regular backup schedules
ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Next 1-2 weeks):
Fix State Management - This is blocking proper operation flow
Complete PLC Configuration - Add missing Clean and Pressure Test addresses
Add Error Handling - Make the system more robust
Implement State Recovery - Handle PLC-agent state mismatches
   LONG-TERM VISION (Next 3-6 months):
OPC UA Migration - Modernize the communication protocol
Web Interface - Add remote monitoring capabilities
Advanced Automation - Scheduled operations and batch processing
Production Deployment - Move from POC to production system
