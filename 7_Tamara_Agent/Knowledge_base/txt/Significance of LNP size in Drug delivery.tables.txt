## Exploring LNP Size and its Significance in Drug Delivery

## Introduction to LNP Size:

The development of advanced drug delivery systems, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNP) has revolutionized modern medicine. These sub-micron size carriers, composed of a combination of lipids, offer a versatile platform for transporting an array of therapeutic agents: mRNA, siRNA, small drugs... A critical factor in optimizing their performance is the size of these nanoparticles which plays a pivotal role in determining their behavior within biological systems, influencing their efficacy, stability, and cellular uptake. In this article, we will explain the importance of LNP size on the drug delivery process, introduce you to the methods to measure it accurately and elaborate on how you can tailor your LNP for an optimized delivery efficiency.

## Why is Lipid Nanoparticle Size Important?

The size of lipid nanoparticles is a critical attribute that significantly affects their performance as drug delivery carriers. In practice, Stability, encapsulation efficiency, drug release profile, bio-distribution, and cellular uptake are amongst the most affected delivery parameters influenced by its size.

## LNP size impact on Biodistribution

Smaller LNPs tend to exhibit both prolonged circulation times and an enhanced ability to accumulate at target tissues. Tissue accumulation is principally due to a phenomenon known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, in which small LNPs leak through blood vessels and evade immune surveillance to accumulate around tumors. Additionally, prolonged circulation time can be obtained by using nanoparticles between 20 and 150 nm, which helps reduce liver clearance and kidney filtration. [1]

## Lipid nanoparticle size's importance for Cellular uptake

The size of LNPs also plays a decisive role in determining their cellular uptake and internalization. The most important cellular uptake mechanism for small molecules is endocytosis. Endocytosis relies on the transport of material into the cells by enveloping them in its phospholipid bilayer. Numerous endocytosis mechanisms are reported, and the kinetic of entry will differ depending on the LNP size. Considering their size of around 100 nm, LNP will be mostly taken up through receptor-mediated endocytosis, which also applies to viruses of similar sizes such as influenza (80nm) and reoviruses (120nm) [2]

Additionally, it is important to take into account that ideal LNP particle size - as well as lipid nanoparticle surface chemistry - would vary from species to species: For instance, optimal LNP size for non-human primates appears to be smaller (50-60nm) than for rodents (70-80nm) [3]

In summary, the process of cellular uptake through endocytosis is significantly impacted by the physicochemical characteristics of nanocarrier systems, where particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) play key roles.

## Lipid Nanoparticle Size Characterization Methods

As we previously introduced, LNP size is a key factor for efficient nanoparticle delivery, consequently, accurate measurement of LNP size is imperative for designing effective drug delivery systems.

## Nanoparticle diameter definition

First, it is important to note that several definitions are available for nanoparticle diameter, with the 2 most commonly used ones being: Hydrodynamic diameter or Core diameter.

## LNP Hydrodynamic diameter

The hydrodynamic diameter of a particle represents the diameter of a solid sphere that encounters an equivalent drag force to that experienced by the given particle as it moves through a liquid. This parameter is important in the context of LNP as those are generally surrounded by a PEG brush structure (see our review on LNP for more information on the importance of PEG in LNP). Considering this, using hydrodynamic parameters to compute payload volume can lead to significant errors as the actual size of the nanoparticle containing the payload would be smaller than the measured size.

## LNP Core diameter

Oppositely, the core diameter only takes into account the size of the inner core of the nanoparticle. In the previous example, this would be the value to use to compute an actual LNP payload volume.

## LNP size measurement tools

A range of techniques are employed to determine this critical parameter, each offering specific insights into the physical characteristics of these nanoparticles.  Here is an introduction to the most used methods for LNP size measurement:

## Dynamic light scattering (DLS) for lipid nanoparticle hydrodynamic size measurement

DLS is the most used technique for LNP size characterization. It works by measuring the temporal fluctuations of scattered light due to Brownian motion, providing information about the hydrodynamic diameter of LNPs in solution.

In practice, a polarized laser light source will shoot light through a sample, where it will be diffracted. The scattered light will be measured by a photomultiplier and processed by an autocorrelator to obtain the variation of light intensity over time. Light going through a sample filled with small nanoparticles will show very dynamic measurements, while larger nanoparticles will show slower intensity changes. The final LNP size distribution is then processed from these data.

While DLS is adept at revealing size distribution and polydispersity, it can occasionally overestimate size due to the presence of the solvation layer. The newest generation of DLS systems also allows for the measurement of Zeta potential, making it a very versatile tool for LNP characterization.

## Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) for lipid nanoparticle core size measurement

Cryo-TEM presents another powerful approach. This method entails the rapid freezing of LNPs to preserve their native structure, followed by imaging using transmission electron microscopy. CryoTEM furnishes high-resolution images that lay bare the morphology and size of LNPs - including both the hydrodynamic and core diameter.

However, it's worth noting that Cryo-TEM is slow, labor-intensive, and expensive, and can only be used to characterize a small part of the samples but not batches.

## Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) for LNP size measurement

Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) operates on the principle of tracking individual nanoparticles' Brownian motion in real time. This technique offers insights into particle size, size distribution, and concentration, making it particularly well-suited for heterogeneous LNP samples.

However, it is not well suited for nanoparticle sizes smaller than 30 nm due to the influence of Brownian motion and requires good knowledge of the instrument to properly use it.

## Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensing (TRPS) for nanoparticle size measurement

TRPS operates based on the principle of electrophoresis, which involves applying an electric field across a nanopore embedded in a thin membrane that separates two chambers containing the sample and the electrolyte solution. The nanopore acts as a single-molecule sensor, allowing particles to pass through one at a time. As particles traverse the nanopore, they cause temporary changes in the electrical resistance, creating characteristic electrical pulses that are analyzed to extract valuable information about the particles, including size.

While providing numerous valuable information, TRPS can be tricky to use as it requires extremely precise calibration, and nanopore clogging can regularly occur in the system, requiring long sample preparation.

Additionally, other techniques such as static light scattering, electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy contribute to the understanding of LNP size and morphology.

## How to control LNP size?

The size of LNPs is influenced by a multitude of factors, stemming from both formulation and processing stages.

## Influence of composition on lipid nanoparticle size

The lipid nanoparticle composition stands as a pivotal factor, with the choice of lipids and their ratios intricately determining LNP size.

First, the helper sterol lipid content, influencing lipid packing and nanoparticle dimensions depending on the lipids it is linked to, will greatly impact LNP size and shape.

Additionally, PEG-lipid, though only present in a very small proportion, seems to play a major role on the final LNP size. In a study by M. Lokugamage et al. [4], it was demonstrated that lipid-based nanoparticles lacking PEG were notably larger, exceeding 200nm, in comparison to those containing as little as 0.5% mol PEG, which maintained a size of approximately 80nm. [5]

This would be explained by the fact that the PEG-lipid is primarily situated at the surface of LNPs. Consequently, increasing the mol% of PEG-lipid (found on the surface) is believed to result in a heightened surface area-to-volume ratio, consequently leading to a reduction in particle size.

## Influence of manufacturing on lipid nanoparticle size

The manufacturing methods of the LNP are equally pivotal.

Numerous techniques are available for the synthesis of lipid nanoparticles.

Traditional methods like solvent evaporation or high-pressure homogenization tend to produce poor size control due to erratic mixing mechanisms, leading to broad size distribution and very low reproducibility.

To overcome these limitation, novel LNP synthesis techniques based on self-assembly have been developed. In those, two liquids: a solvent - usually ethanol containing the lipids - and an anti-solvent - usually water with dissolved RNA - are mixed, triggering the self-assembly of LNP.  With these methods, the faster the mixing speed, the smaller the particles will get, allowing the user to finely tune their nanoparticle size simply by playing with the synthesis parameters.

To obtain such a fine control of the mixing conditions, thus yielding more uniform LNPs with much finer controlled sizes and improved repeatability, microfluidics mixing methods are used. Microfluidics indeed offers the unique ability to produce repeatable and controllable mixing conditions, proving to be a major game changer for those applications. Have a look at our microfluidics synthesis of nanoparticle review to learn more about the

microfluidics synthesis of LNP!

On top of this, as introduced in our article on the influence of dialysis on LNP parameters, the postprocess solvent extraction step can lead to major changes on the nanoparticle size.

Further still, processing parameters such as mixing speed, temperature, concentration, and solvent choice directly impact LNP size during formulation. The physical stability of LNPs plays a role as well; events such as aggregation or fusion can alter their dimensions over time.

## Conclusion

Lipid nanoparticles have reshaped the realm of drug delivery by offering a platform for targeted and controlled therapeutic agent release. Among the myriad of parameters steering LNP behavior, size emerges as a pivotal factor influencing biodistribution, cellular uptake, and overall effectiveness. Employing advanced characterization techniques like DLS, Cryo-TEM, and TNA, scientists gain insight into LNP size, allowing for tailored drug delivery systems. Additionally, in light of the importance of the composition and the manufacturing methods on the final nanoparticle size, it appears to be extremely important to choose them very carefully.

In the dynamic field of nanomedicine, understanding the factors shaping LNP size holds the key to precision drug delivery systems with enhanced therapeutic impact.
