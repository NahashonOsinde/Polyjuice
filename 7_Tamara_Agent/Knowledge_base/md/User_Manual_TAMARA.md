## II.   T AMARA introduction

## What is TAMARA?

The TAMARA Nanoparticle Formulation System is a user friendly, microfluidic-based platform tailored to researchers  seeking  ease  of  use  and  precision  in nanoparticle synthesis.

Ideal for both newcomers to the nanoparticle field, beginners  in  microfluidics  as  well  as  seasoned experts aiming to streamline their processes, this system offers a seamless journey in crafting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), liposomes and other various polymeric and lipidic nanoparticles.

By  leveraging the  most  advanced  microfluidics technology, TAMARA  provides  optimal  controlover key nanoparticle characteristics including:

Particle size

Polydispersity index (PDI)

Batch-to-batch repeatability

This  fine-tuned  control  translates  to  optimal  in-vivo  and  in-vitro  results, elevating the efficacy of your research endeavors.

Although this user manual mainly focuses on LNP due to their pivotal role in RNA delivery for vaccines and gene therapies, the TAMARA platform has  also  been  tested  on liposomes , LNPs , PLGA  nanoparticles ,  and SLNs ,  making  it  a  versatile  solution  for  any  lipid-based  and  polymeric nanoparticle synthesis.

## Why are nanoparticles characteristics control so important?

The  main  role  of  a  nanoparticle  is  to  act  as  a  delivery  system  for  Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API such as cancer drugs, mRNA, siRNAâ¦) within cells. In this context, the physicochemical characteristics of a nanoparticle (size, PDI and

EE%)  are  critical  as  they  determine  the  particle  payload,  influence nanoparticle interaction with cells and biological tissues, their toxicity and pharmacokinetics.

Even a small difference in these parameters can lead to very different results in terms of drug delivery efficiency, and ultimately transfection efficiency.

## Importance of particle size

Size is a critical quality attribute of a nanoparticle affecting stability, encapsulation efficiency, biodistribution and cellular uptake amongst others. Indeed, the endocytosis process of the nanoparticle into the cell, will greatly vary depending on its size. Optimal nanoparticle size will thus vary depending on the payload, the target cell and the model used (in vitro, mice, primateâ¦). As a rule of the thumb typical LNP size are

3D represented LNP

in the order of 60 to 120 nm, as too large nanoparticles (&gt; 200 nm) lead to liver clearance and kidney filtration, while too small nanoparticle can be toxic. TAMARA offers a unique way to finely control nanoparticle size , thus allowing for  the optimization of your intracellular drug release.

When it comes to characterization, nanoparticle size has 2 possible definitions: hydrodynamic diameter (generally measure via DLS) or core diameter (generally measured via Cryo-TEM). Learn more in our review on the importance of nanoparticle size:

## Influence of Polydispersity Index (PDI)

The PDI is used to describe the degree of non uniformity of the nanoparticle population . PDI is critical in the context of drug delivery as it affects both delivery efficiency and toxicity.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Hence the closer to 0 the PDI is, the more monodisperse the population is. While industry good practice suggests that the PDI value should remain below 0.3 for lipid-based nanoparticle drug products, the smaller the better.

Using the most advanced microfluidics technology, the TAMARA platform allows for the best possible PDI within one formulation (generally around 0.1 for RNA-LNP)

## Encapsulation efficiency (EE%)

The encapsulation efficiency refers to the nanoparticle's ability to efficiently encapsulate the drug of interest. It is defined as the trapped drug over the total amount in the formulation.

Microfluidics methods used in the TAMARA platform provide the highest level of efficiency, reaching up to 98% of RNA into LNP.

## How does lipid-based and polymeric nanoparticle synthesis work?

Historically, the formulation of nanoparticles was carried out using standard bulk processes (precipitation, emulsion, solvent evaporation and sonication).

However,  these  techniques  suffer  from  broad  size  distribution  and  poor  batch-to-batch reproducibility, proving very limiting for biological application. High energy methods were then introduced, such as high pressure homogeneization. They involve high energy to mix reagents and break down nanoparticles into smaller pieces. While more robust, this method shows the same limitations as regular batch methods for biological applications.

To overcome this, continuous process in macrofluidics have been introduced. Involving the rapid mixing of 2 liquids (a solvent containing the lipids/polymers and an antisolvent, usually water). They trigger the nanoparticle synthesis by nanoprecipitation.

Although much more efficient, these methods were limited when working at small scale, and showed poor repeatability due to the turbulent aspect of mixing. For this reason, microfluidics emerged as the preferred solution to improve final particle  characteristics .  Thanks  to  its ability  to  handle  small  volumes  and  reproduce  mixing  conditions,  microfluidics  offer  many advantages for the synthesis of high quality nanoparticles.

## What is nanoparticle synthesis with microfluidics?

The most common nanoparticle formulation method relies on the fast mixing of two miscible phases (lipids/polymers  in  an  organic  solvent  and  aqueous  buffer),  leading  to  a  drop  in solubility of the lipids/polymers, which start to agglomerate to form nanoparticles. This method is commonly refered to as nanoprecipitation/self-assembly process.

As one can observe, the mixing speed has a major influence on the synthesized nanoparticle size. The  faster  the  mixing,  the  smaller  the  nanoparticle  is. Also,  the  more  efficient  and homogeneous the mixing is, the better the control over the size and distribution.

Therefore, ensuring a uniform and constant mixing time throughout the process is crucial to optimize your final nanoparticle size control and homogeneity. More information can be found in our organic nanoparticle formation review.

In this context, microfluidics is the ideal solution thanks to its unique ability to maintain the fluid flow in laminar conditions, thus permitting excellent reproducibility of the mixing condition for optimal control of the final nanoparticle physicochemical parameters.

Outside nanoprecipitation, nanoparticles can also be formulated using this system through other methods such as nanoemulsion.

## Microfluidic mixing

Multiple  strategies  can  be  used  to  mix  fluids  in  microfluidics  such  as  T-junction,  baffle, recombination, and flow focusing (2D or 3D)... More information can be found on our website.

In the TAMARA platform, the provided chip has 2 designs: a herringbone mixer and a baffle mixer . By simply rotating the chip, one can easily interchange the mixers.

## Herringbone mixer

The staggered herringbone has been chosen as this mixing method based on chaotic - though repeatable - flows offers the best flexibility in terms of mixing time control (thus range of achievable nanoparticle size), while providing excellent repeatability through the process (thus nanoparticle uniformity) together with a very large accessible flow rate range (easy work with small and large volumes).

The mixing principle of a herringbone mixer relies on the creation of micro-vortices in  a ridged  microchannel,  where  the  2  streams  of  reagents  are  injected.  Those  micro-vortices induce  a  'folding'  of  the  2  liquid  phases  on  themselves,  greatly  increasing  the  exchange surface between the 2 phases.

## Baffle mixer

The baffle mixer is offered as an alternative solution to the herringbone mixer as it permits a faster mixing using Dean vortices to achieve smaller nanoparticles at higher total flow rate than the herringbone mixing.

## What are the most important synthesis parameters influencing the characteristics of your nanoparticles?

In addition to the composition of the organic solution (type, molecular weight, molar ratios, and concentration), and the composition of the aqueous solution (pH, salt content, presence of surfactants), the physicochemical parameters of your nanoparticles are also dependent on the synthesis conditions (characteristics of the chips, flow rate conditionsâ¦). Bear in mind that for the specific case of RNA-LNP, the RNA length also can have influence on the final nanoparticle characteristics.

We will now give an overview of the most important formulation parameters and how they generally influence nanoparticle size (bear in mind that in some specific cases, these behaviors can be different).

## Flow Rate Ratio (FRR)

The Flow Rate Ratio (FRR) is an important parameter to play with when generating nanoparticles using a microfluidic mixer as it impacts both size and encapsulation efficiency.

FRR is defined as the ratio between the flow rate of the aqueous phase and the flow rate of the organic phase. For example, an FRR of 10:1 corresponds to the flow rate of the aqueous buffer being 10 times higher than the flow rate of the organic solution. FRR impacts size at a low flow rate - especially before dialysis - Â  while it has a lower to no impact at high flow rates. In addition to this, FRR has a major impact on encapsulation efficiency - EE% in a herringbone mixer (see characterization results).

## Total Flow Rate (TFR)

The Total Flow Rate (TFR) is the parameter that impacts the final NP size most with a herringbone mixer. It is defined as the sum of the flow rates of the aqueous phase and the organic phase. For example, if you set the flow rate of the lipids to 100 ÂµL/min and use an FRR of 5:1, the TFR in your system will be 600 ÂµL/min. This parameter significantly impacts the nanoparticles produced with the herringbone mixer as the liquids are mixed by chaotic mixing. This means that increasing the TFR will decrease the mixing time, thus decreasing the size of NPs.

## Lipid/Polymer Formulation and Concentration

The  Lipid/Polymer  Formulation  and  Concentration  in  the  organic  phase  are  crucial  factors determining the final size of the NPs. In general, a higher lipid concentration leads to smaller NPs, especially when working at high aqueous: organic FRR. The lipid formulation used as an example throughout this user manual is composed of 4 different lipids that are similar to those used in vaccine and drug delivery development (also known as LNP). This user guide provides the exact recipe to replicate this formulation and the range of sizes we obtained.

## A few other parameters are summarized in the following table:

| pH                           | The influence of this factor will depend on the type of molecules used in your formulation (neutral, cationic, ionizableâ¦)   |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Temperature                  | Higher temperature during mixing generally leads to smaller NPs                                                              |
| Buffer composition           | Certain buffers can cause your NPs to agglomerate (e.g. PBS will increase aggregation of cationic NPs)                       |
| Geometry of the microchannel | A faster mixing after the contact point of the two streams leads to smaller NPs                                              |

## III.   System overview

## Introduction

Synthesis module

## Functional specifications

## Controller module

The  controller  is  the core  control  element  of  the  system .  It  has  been  designed  for  easy operation,  with  an  intuitive  user  interface,  and  high  control  accuracy,  with  its  embedded pressure controller.

## Synthesis module

The Synthesis module contains all the fluidics elements of the system: the microfluidic chip and the reservoir. It has been designed to be easily opened for a quick refill, while keeping it tightly closed during runs and cleans.

For proper operation, the Synthesis module should be connected to the Controller module using the provided pneumatic cable. The holder for vial should be plugged in front, with a collection vial in place.

During operation, the lid should always be kept close.

## Microfluidic chip

The microfluidic chip contains the fluidic mixing module for the synthesis of the LNP. 2 designs are available head to toes on each chip: baffle mixer and herringbone mixer. The chip is made of COC (topas) and is compatible with most polar organic solvents. For more, please chemical compatibility table in the Appendix.

For proper operation, the chip should be put at the appropriate location in the Synthesis module, with the provided gasket. Only use the chips and gaskets provided by Inside Therapeutics with the system.

Always start a new run with a dry chip. If you decide to reuse your chips, use the purge function to ensure it.

While the chips can be cleaned and reused multiple times, please note that Inside Therapeutics only commits on the succesful outcome of the first run.

## Reservoir

The reservoir contains the 2 liquids tanks (for the aqueous phase and lipid phase) as well as the optimized fluidic path to connect to the chip. The reservoir is made of PEEK for optimal chemical compatibility.

For proper operation, the reservoir should be put at the appropriate location in the Synthesis module, with the provided gasket. Do not use other reservoirs and gaskets than the ones provided by Inside Therapeutics with the system.

Two reservoirs are available:

## Reservoir S with two tanks 1.6 mL or Reservoir M with two tanks 23 mL

| Reservoir                    | S               | L              |
|------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Inlet tank                   | 1.6 mL x2       | 23 mL x2       |
| Advised Total Working Volume | 0.2 mL to 3 mL* | 1 mL to 30 mL* |

* Can varry depending on formulation parameters (Concentrations, lipid type...)

Do not exceed the maximum volume indicated when filling the reservoir with liquid. Always maintain a minimum distance of 1 cm between the liquid surface and the top of the reservoir.

## Before getting started

- Ensure that both the power and pressure supply are correctly connected
- Make sure that the Controller module is connected to the Synthesis module
- Turn the Controller module on
- Note that this protocol is for a standard cleaning. Advanced cleaning can also be carried out by autoclaving the reservoir.

REMINDER : Please note that while we allow chip cleaning, cleaning the chip for reuse may not be possible with every sample, as chip reusability can vary significantly depending on factors such as composition, concentration and volume. To maximize chip reusability, follow each step of the process carefully. Always remember to finish your procedure with a purge to ensure the chip is dry for your next run.

While the chips can be cleaned and potentially reused multiple times, please note that Inside Therapeutics only commits on the successful outcome of the first run.

Our suggested cleaning procedure involves a cleansing of the reservoir using the solvent used for the formulation in the Solvent reservoir and a water solution in the aqueous reservoir.

This protocol should be customized by the user depending on its cleanliness requirements. If needed, additional cleaning steps can be incorporated such as cleaning with harsher solvent (always ensure the solvent compatibility by using polar solvent), multiple cleaning cycles...

For RNA removal , commercially available solutions like RNAse AWAY or RNaseZap can be used. Ensure thorough cleaning of the machine following their use to remove any residue.

## Standard Cleaning protocol

## Launch a clean 1.

- On the settings, make sure the right reservoir (S or L) size is selected .
- On the home screen of the Controller module, press " Clean "

## Get started 2.

- Close the lid with the chip in place
- Install a new collection vial to the outlet

Remove the holder to install the collection vial if the chip is already connected.

## Purge 3.

- Fill your reservoir with your cleaning solutions (you can use your solvent, a water-based solution, NaOHâ¦ as long as it is compatible with the reservoir and the chip). Insert a new

## gasket and the chip

- Close your Synthesis module
- Press Next on the Controller module

Never  fill  the  reservoir with  more  liquid  than the indicated maximum volume. Always maintain a minimum distance of 1cm between the liquid surface and the top of the reservoir.

## Clean 5.

- Press on the play button to launch your clean
- Wait until all the cleaning solution has been injected
- Once done, press on next to go back to the home page

After cleaning your system, always ensure it is perfectly dry before launching a new run. You can run an extra purge to ensure it.

## Carry out a blank run, check volumes and purge 6.

- To confirm the chip is cleaned : carry out a blank run with your solvent and water under your specified condition
- Confirm that the run has been succesfull by comparing the expected volume vs the collected one (error up to 10% is acceptable). If higher, use a new chip. If not, dry your chip and go for a new run

## VII.    Going further

## Outlet reservoir holder installation

Reservoir holder sizes: 1.5 mL or 2 mL / 15 mL / 50 mL

Select the most suitable holder considering your reservoir size:

- For 1.5 mL or 2 mL Eppendorf reservoir, use the middle holder

For 15 mL Falcon , use the right most holder

For 50 mL Falcon , use the left most holder

## Holder installation

tube holder

## Gasket installation

- Take one gasket out of its package ans insert it on the reservoir.

Make sure the outlets of the reservoir are well aligned with the gasket holes.

It is advised to either carefully clean or change the gaskets after each run. If you hear some hissing noise during a clean or a run, please make sure no leakage has occured. If so, clean and dry both surfaces.

## Chip installation

## Chip set up

- Take out the chip from their package.
- Select the chip design type you want to use (baffle mixer or herringbone mixer).
- Plug the chip upside down to the reservoir module. Always make sure the inlet/outlets are pointing downwards.
- Make sure that the outlet of your choosen design is pointing towards the output reservoir.
- Ensure that the gasket holes and the chip inlets are properly aligned.

Beware that the chips has 2 designs, make sure that you are using the one you selected by checking the mixer design visually.

## Very small volumes

Procedure for Working with Very Small Volumes (less than 1 mL total)

When handling very small volumes, we highly suggest you pipetting directly into the outlet to minimize the risk of air bubbles. Follow these steps:

## Preparation

- Remove the chip and the gasket from the system.

## Pipetting

- Insert the pipette tip straight into the outlet, ensuring it touches the bottom of the hole.
- Lift it slightly
- Dispense the liquid very gently (not to create an overflow) until the first stop of the pipette. Avoid pressing beyond the first stop to prevent introducing air bubbles.
- Place the gasket, the chip and close the lid.

## Additional Tips

- Always pipette the aqueous phase first, followed by the solvent phase.
- Avoid introducing any air bubbles into the system at all times.
- This method ensures optimal performance and minimizes issues caused by bubbles in the system

## System maintenance

## Basic maintenance

The instrument has been designed so that maintenance is kept to a minimum.

To maintain the system in optimal working condition, please follow those guidelines:

When done with using the system always carry out a final cleaning of both your reservoir and chip, followed by a complete purge of the system with air.

Never leave any liquids in the system when not in use.

Always empty the drain at the back of the Synthesis module if you see any liquid in it.

O-rings are used to connect the pressure cable and the controller, the pressure cable and the Synthesis module as well as to ensure connexion between reservoir and Synthesis module. Make sure those remain clean while you are using your system.

Please reach out to support@insidetx.com should you require a spare set of o-rings.

## Cleanning the system

## Controller module

The controller touchscreen can periodically be cleaned using a wipe.

Do not use or spill liquid on the TAMARA Controller module

## Moving the system

If it is necessary to move the system, the following guidelines should be followed:

- Always disconnect the power supply and the cable connecting the controller and the Synthesis module before attempting to move the system.
- Always adopt proper lifting techniques to avoid back injury.
- Always lift the instrument by holding it under its base. Never lift a module by its handle.
- If  the  system  is  to  be  moved  large  distances  then  it  is  recommended  that  it  is repacked in its original packaging

## VIII. Frequently asked questions

## Chips

## Can I reuse the chips?

The chips provided with the TAMARA platform have been designed to be cleaned in order to be reused.

However, because the system works using direct pressure control (no flow control), the clogging of the system can lead to alteration in the flow rate condition, and thus nanoparticle synthesis conditions. For this reason, Inside Therapeutics only commits to the succesfull outcome of the first run with a chip, when surely no agglomeration is present.

## How many times can I reuse a chip?

The number of times you can reuse your chip will depend on multiple parameters including formulation, concentration, volumes...

## When should I change my chip for a new one ?

When the chip is clogged. Here are several elements to identify whether your chip is clogged:

- Important difference between the target volume and the total volume produced with the system
- If you visually observe that the chip is dirty/clogged
- If one reservoir does not get fully empty during a cleaning or a blank run

## What are the best practice to reuse the chips ?

Don't use too concentrated samples or too large volumes. Always dry the chip after use. When going for a new run:

- Clean the chip well following the provided instructions
- Carry out a blank run with solvent/water to confirm the chip is not clogged by checking the output volume correspondance
- Run a thorough purge to make sure the chip is perfectly dry
- Launch a new run

## Gasket

## Can I reused the gasket ?

Yes, you can reuse it as long as the gasket integrity has not been compromised.

## Can reusing the gasket lead to cross contamination?

As long as you properly clean it, the gasket can be used mutliple times.

## Synthesis module

## I observe liquid in the collector in the back drain., is this normal?

While this should not happen under standard run conditions, liquid will get into the back drain if backflow occurs during a run or a clean. This likely means that your chip is clogged and the only way out for the liquids is through the inlet.

## The lid does not seem air tight or liquid tight what should I do?

Make sure that the o-rings connection the reservoir and the lid are in good condition, and that nothing interferes with the closing of the lid. Reach out to support@insidetx.com should there be any questions.

## When and how should I change the o-ring?

If you observe any alteration of the o-rings, or leaks of air or liquids through them, please change them using the spare set provided with the system.

## I struggle closing the handle, is it normal? what should I do?

This can happen the air will apply about 20kg of upward force onto the lid. It needs to be tighly maintained closed. If it seems abnormally hard to close, check that the handle forks engage correctly on the rotation cames, that the chip is correctly positionned flat on the gasket. Check that the back of the lid is correctly depressed before rotating the handle.

## Cleanning your system

## How can I clean the chip, gasket and reservoir?

To clean the chip, gasket and reservoir, please follow the instruction of the clean section presented  above.  For  the  gasket,  you  can  clean  it  with  any  silicone-compatible  cleaning solution (NaOH, RNAseAway, Ethanolâ¦)

## How often should I clean the chip?

Please  clean  the  chip  and  the  reservoir  after  each  run  to  avoid  cross  contamination  and agglomeration.

After every clean, please make sure the chip is perfectly dry before launching a new run.

## Can I autoclave the chips?

The thermoplastic material used in the chip would not withstand an autoclave process.

## Can I autoclave the reservoir?

The reservoir is made of PEEK so you can autoclave it to ensure its sterility.

## Can I autoclave the entire module?

The controller and the Synthesis module should never be autoclaved.

## What cleaning solution can I use?

You should use liquids compatible with the wetted material (PEEK, Silicone and COC).

For COC chemical compatibility, please refer to the table in appendix.

## Which cleaning solutions do you recommend ?

For the lipids: your solvent, for RNA: NaOH

You can also use RNAseAway to remove any RNAse from the system.

## I notice a drop on the chip at the end of my cleaning ?

It can happen with some solvent due to their wettability. Dry and clean it during a wipe.

## Is the system RNAse free ?

All our equipment is handled with the most care regarding RNAse contamination, however it is not RNAse-free certified.

For  your  reference,  the  Controller  module,  Synthesis  module  and  reservoirs  have  been  thoroughly cleaned with RNAseAway solution before packaging and shipping from our premises. The chips are manufactured without human intervention.

## I hear some hissing noise during my clean, where does that come from?

It is likely to come from leaks between the reservoir and the Synthesis module.

Please check both the gasket between the chip and reservoir, and the o-rings. Make sure both are cleaned and dry after each runs.

## There is spray coming from the chip during cleaning ? How can I avoid it?

This can happen as a spray can appear when too much air is present in the chip during cleaning.

You can clean the Synthesis module with a wipe if this happens. To minimize it, you can place a piece of soft tubing at the chip exit point or use a "highÂ reservoir"

## No liquid is coming out during the cleaning, what's happening?

Stop the cleaning as soon as possible. There are 2 possible for it:

- The system is not fed with enough pressure, so please check your pressure input
- Your chip is clogged. If so, please change it. Please check your drain collector at the back of the Synthesis module and empty it if needed.

## Run

## I observe that my output volume is far from the target volume, is that normal ?

If you observe this, it is likely that your chip has gotten partially/fully clogged and it is time to change it. Note that small variation of output volume (+/- 5%) can be observed with no consequences on the performance of the system.

Note that when a clogging occurs in a chip, the contents of one reservoir may enter another, leading to contamination. In extreme situations, the fluids could even flow back towards the controller. To mitigate this, a set of internal safety filters is installed to stop any reverse flow from progressing further. This reversed flow is directed into a safety collector located at the module's back, which you should empty.

## I observe bubble at the start or at the end of my run, is that normal ?

While  the  system  has  been  optimized  to  avoid  bubble  appearance,  TAMARA  remains  a microfluidic-based system, and as with any other microfluidic setup bubble can occur. However, thanks to the excellent response time of the pressure controller, the small bubble you might see appearing at the start and end of your run should not affect your run outcome.

To minimize this, make sure that no bubble is present is your reservoir when launching a run. When working with small volumes, you can "tap" the reservoir remove bubbles stucked in the fluidic path.

## I observe cross contamination during my run. How did that happen ?

Cross contamination can occur if the cleaning process has not been properly carried out.

Should you want to make sure no cross contamination happens, use one chip per experiment and thoroughly autoclave your reservoirs.

## I have a limited accessible TFR or volume range in my system, how to improve it ?

It can happen as TFR and total volume are constrained by several elements including minimum run  time  (i.e  high  flow  rate  cannot  achieve  small  volumes),  input  pressure  supply  (too  low pressure supply means low accessible flow rate rante), flow rate ratioâ¦

## Miscellaneous

## When should I override my nominal pressure?

If you pressure supply is "weak" or has a low airflow, you can manually decrease it to avoid any issues during your run.

You can always reach out to support@insidetx. com should you have any further questions

## How can I use a custom solvent ?

Other than the presets, you can use a custom solvent. To do so, go on the "Solvent Selection" menu and hit the "other" solvent to use the solvent of your choice. You will need to enter three characteristics depending on the solvent used: the viscosity at 20Â°C (ÂµPa.s), the viscosity sensitivity to temperature, and the molar volume (L/mol).

4. Although  the  system  is  a  safe  for  operation,  we  recommend  using  personal protective equipment when using it (mask, glasses, gloves, and lab coat).
5. Only Inside Therapeutics' trained personal is permitted to open the instrument
6. Do not smoke, nor eat or drink near the system, particularly when inflammable sample are at use.
7. Always close the TAMARA Synthesis module's lid when performing a run or a clean.

## Fluidic safety

1. Only use the chips provided by Inside Therapeutics with the system
2. For  the  safety  of  the  user  and  the  instrument,  do  not  use  the  instrument  in connection with substances that may emit toxic or corrosive fumes, such as acids or alkalis.
3. No liquids should be in contact with the TAMARA controller. Avoid passing electrical cables through areas where the liquid can spill.
4. For  best  performance,  allow  TAMARA  to  warm  up  and  stabilize  for  at  least  15 minutes before starting any experiment.
5. Do not use TAMARA with explosive or corrosive gases or liquids, as this would put the user at risk and damage the instrument. Be careful to disconnect TAMARA quick-connect fittings correctly by pressing the outer ring while pulling out the element to disconnect (tubing or plug).
6. Always test a new sample or solvent for chemical compatibility before use. Only use solution compatible with the materials in contact with the liquids (COC and PEEK)..
7. After each formulation, scrupulously clean the system to remove any contaminants before making another  formulation
8. Do  not  exceed  the  maximum  volume  indicated  when  filling  the  reservoir  with liquid. Always maintain a minimum distance of 1cm between the liquid surface and the height of the reservoir.
9. Always handle substances in accordance with any local regulations concerning sample handling safety

## Electrical and pressure safety

1. Only use the provided 24V DC power supply. The power supply can be easily disconnected from the back of the device.
2. The ideal input pressure should be between 8 and 10bar. Do not connect TAMARA to a pressure source greater than 10bar.
3. TAMARA must be used exclusively with non-explosive, non corrosive neutral, dry, dust- and oil-free, and particle-filtered gases at a minimum particle size of 5Âµm this would put the user at risk and damage the instrument. . It cannot be used with pure oxygen or in any other fire-risk situation.
4. Use a particle/humidity filter between the pressure source and TAMARA. Please refer to ISO 8573-1, cl. 3 for detailed information.

## Appendix C: Jun-air compressor installation and maintenance

Refer to this section only if you have been provided with a Jun-Air compressor together with the system.

## Connecting the Jun-Air compressor to TAMARA

Replace the red cap (Fig 1.a) on the air intake tube with the intake filter in the plastic bag (Fig 1.b). You need to push hard to put it in place .

Fig 1 Jun-Air air intake filter installation

Add the module comprising a particle/humidity filter with a pressure limiting knob as depicted on Fig 2.a.

Add the output pressure toggle switch at the end of the particle/humidity filter (Fig 2.b).

You must use a wrench to tighten the filter and the toggle correctly.

Then connect a piece of 6 mm OD pneumatic tubing from the output pressure toggle switch (Fig. 2.b) to your TAMARA device (Fig 2.c).

Fig 2a. Addition of the particle/ humidity filter with the pressure limiting knob

Fig 2b. Addition of the toggle

Fig 2c. Regular compressor output mounting

## At this point, all pneumatic connections are in place.

The following section which will help you make sure that the compressed air delivered to TAMARA by the Jun-Air unit is at a constant and adequate level of pressure.

What' we're aiming for is a constant pressure of no more than 10 bar delivered constantly to the TAMARA, ideally at 1 bar above the operating pressure needed for the synthesis.

## Setting up the Jun-Air unit to deliver adequate compressed air

Fig 3. Manometers and valves

Fig 4. Compressor's manometer indicating 10 bar

1. Before setting up the Jun-Air unit, disconnect the output tubing from TAMARA. We will need the compressed air output outlet to be able to vent in order to tune the pressure settings.
2. Plug the Jun-Air unit into an electrical outlet, and switch it on by turning the output pressure toggle switch on the pressure regulator cover (Fig 5.a).
3. The compressor will immediately start building pressure in the tank.
4. When the needle of the air tank's manometer (Fig 3.a) reaches maximum cut-off pressure , the compressor will shut off.
5. Now, gently open the output toggle switch to vent the air of the tank into the room.
6. Observe the needle on the air tank's manometer (Fig 3.a). When the tank's pressure drops below a certain level ( the minimum cut-in pressure ), the compressor will turn on and start building up pressure, up to the maximum cut-off pressure as before

## To ensure optimal TAMARA performance, the system should follow these conditions:

- The maximum cut-off pressure is at least 1.5 bar above the operating pressure of your TAMARA  (e.g. : if you need 8 bar for your synthesis, the maximum cut-off pressure should be at least 9.5 bar)
- The minimum cut-in pressure is at least 1 bar above the operating pressure of your TAMARA  (e.g. : if you need 8 bar for your synthesis, the minimum cut-in pressure should be at least 9 bar)
- The maximum cut-off pressure and minimum cut-in pressure can be as far apart as you like. The further apart , the less often the compressor will be activated. B

If you want to tune the minimum cut-in pressure or the maximum cut-off pressure , the following section will tell you how.

If the the minimum cut-in pressure and the maximum cut-off pressure are already correctly set up according to you, skip right to the next section Setting the pressure output limiter

## Tuning the min and max pressure for the compressor.

Fig 5.a. Pressure regulator cover

Fig 5.b. Tightening these two nuts (A) will increase the minimum cut-in pressure

Fig 5.c. Tightening this nut (B) will increase the maximum cut-off pressure

The min and max pressures are set up by turning hexagonal nuts accessible by removing the pressure regulator cover (Fig. 5a). You will need a Phillips screwdriver to remove its screws.

## WARNING : This will expose the electrical leads powering the compressor.

When manipulating the A and B nuts, always ensure that the electrical cable is unplugged, as touching the leads could electrocute you.

Before you plug the cable back in to test your setting, always put the cover (5.a) back on to avoid any accidental contact with the leads.

## The B nut (Fig. 5c) sets the maximum cut-off pressure

- To  increase  it,  screw  the  nut  clockwise,  loading  the  spring.  Do  not  increase  it beyond 10 bar for use with TAMARA.
- To decrease it, screw the nut anti-clockwise, de-loading the spring

## The A nuts (Fig 5b) sets the minimum cut-in pressure

- To increase it, screw the nuts clockwise, loading the springs. Try to keep both nuts somewhat level, although it's not critical. The reason there are two of them is to allow for finer tuning.
- To decrease it, screw the nuts anti-clockwise, de-loading the springs

Once the minimum cut-in pressure and maximum cut-off pressure are set to satisfactory levels, screw the pressure regulator cover (5a) back.

The following section will explain how to perform the final setting, the output pressure limiter.

## Setting the output pressure limiter

Fig 6. Setting the Jun-Air compressor pressure pump output value.

1. Check  that  the  toggle  switch  is closed (Fig 3.b)
2. Open the valve (Fig 6.a) Then pull the  output  pressure  limiter  knob upward (Fig 6.b) and turn it to adjust the  output  pressure  displayed  on the output manometer (Fig 6.c)
3. Then secure it again by pushing the knob back down
4. You  may  now  open  the  output toggle switch (Fig 3.b) and connect it to TAMARA

## Jun-Air unit maintenance

Before any of these maintenance operation, unplug the Jun-Air unit from its electrical outlet and empty the air tank.

## Purge

A  purge  needs  to  be  performed  regularly.  We  advise  you  to  do  it  once  a  week.  When compressing air, humidity and oil can be trapped in the tank. The purge is necessary to remove it and clean the tank.

To purge the compressor, first close the toggle switch (Fig 3.b). Wait for the air compression to be completed and then turn off the air compressor.

Use a tank (it could be a bottle or a cup) and place it at the outlet of the purge valve (Fig 7.a). Open the valve and wait for all the air to come out. On its way out, it draws off water and oil, enabling the compressor to be cleaned.

This process should be repeated until no more liquid gets out.

## Air filters

The compressor filters (5 Âµm and 0.01 Âµm, Fig 7.b) should be checked regularly and replaced if needed.

## Oil level

The air compressor is shipped with the right oil level and with a spare oil bottle.

You should  check  the  oil  level  regularly  and  add  oil  if  necessary.  The  oil  level  should  be between minimum and maximum values (Fig 8).
