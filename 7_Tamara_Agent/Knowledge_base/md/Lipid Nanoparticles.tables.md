Title: General introduction to lipid nanoparticle / The complete guide to understanding Lipid nanoparticles: from synthesize to delivery

## Meta:

Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is a short-term definition of a lipid-based nanoparticle capable of encapsulating various types of nucleic acids.

Lipid nanoparticles' ability to encapsulate and deliver nucleic acids to a specific part of the body has made them a key element to the recent success of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. The unique composition of the lipid nanoparticle allows them to be both very specific and biocompatible, which makes them the lead non-viral delivery systems for oligonucleotide-based therapeutics.

## Introduction to lipid nanoparticles:

Resulting of 50 years of research in the nanocarrier delivery field, lipid nanoparticles are close cousins to other lipid-based nanoparticles such as liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). Unlike those which are specialized in the encapsulation of hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic small molecules, LNPs have the unique capability of encapsulating nucleic acids such as messenger RNA (mRNA), small interference RNA (siRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA)…. And deliver them to a specific location in the body.

Composed of a lipid shell surrounding an internal core made of reverse micelles that encapsulate oligonucleotides, lipid nanoparticles offer both protection from enzymatic degradation to their cargo and their efficient delivery to the target cells.

Those unique features open up immense possibilities for researchers who wish to develop their ribonucleic-based therapeutics and accurately deliver them to a specific location in the body.

Throughout this article, we will give a detailed introduction to why using lipid nanoparticles, and their main characteristics, including composition and structure, describe the available synthesis and characterization methods and present the LNP cargo delivery process to the cells.

## What makes Lipid nanoparticles different from other nanoparticles?

While other lipid-based nanoparticles can be used as a carrier for a wide range of small molecules, their simple structure and the use of neutral lipids pose an issue for the generally negatively charged nucleic acids for several reasons:

1/ The weak interaction between the usually neutral lipids and negatively charged oligonucleotides complicates the encapsulation process.

2/ When introduced to the body, other types of liposomal carriers are subject to clearance from the reticuloendothelial system (RES), leading to a decrease in circulation time in the body.

In the context of RNA delivery, the recently developed lipid nanoparticles have managed to overcome those 2 main limitations by employing a specific combination of lipids to achieve both optimal encapsulation efficiency, protection throughout the transport, and delivery of the nucleic acid to the cells with minimal body interaction.

The first main improvement was to use a cationic lipid instead of the usually neutral ones to better interact with the negatively charged nucleic acids and improve the entrapment capabilities of the LNPs. While providing a much better encapsulation efficiency, the use of cationic lipids also greatly increased the toxicity of the LNPs by triggering an immune response and cytotoxicity, thus not being a viable solution.

To tackle this issue, a new kind of lipid known as ionizable lipids was developed. Those ionizable lipids have the unique capability of switching charge with the pH and being positively charged at low pH while remaining neutral at physiological pH.

This unique capability permits an easy encapsulation of the RNA at low pH while offering much better biocompatibility when brought back to physiological pH for the drug injection into the body. A second added value to the use of the cationic lipid is that, upon entering the endosome, where the pH value drops, lipids get charged again, leading to a destabilization of the LNP and thus an easier delivery of the nucleic acid to the cell.

In addition to this, the combination of the cationic lipid with PEG, cholesterol, and a lipid helper allowed for the generation of a whole new kind of lipid-based nanoparticle with a unique structure and morphology. LNP are formed by a phospholipid bilayer surrounding a core in which nucleic acids are entrapping the nucleic acids.

By adjusting the nature and ratios of each component, one can then fully regulate the interaction with the entrapped nucleic acid and thus tune the LNP encapsulation efficiency, zeta potential… Making the balance of the composition of the LNP, a core component of the drug development process.

## Lipid nanoparticle formulation

What is true for your diet also happens to be true at the nanoscale, where there is both good and bad fat for your body. In the recently developed vaccines, the interactions of the body with the different lipids contained in the nanoparticle are the main reason for the unwanted side effect such as aches, inflammation…

Despite the already much-improved biocompatibility of the LNP compared to other lipid-based nanoparticles thanks to the use of ionizable lipids, major challenges remain to reach a better control of the physiochemical properties of the LNPs, all along the scalability process.

Better lipids to power the next generation of mRNA vaccines.

Therefore, the choice of lipids is crucial to both optimize the LNP encapsulation capability and the delivery of the payload to the target cells.

All the current FDA-approved lipid nanoparticles formulations are composed of 4 lipids ( glycerophospholipids, cationic lipids, sterol lipids, and PEGylated lipids) each having a very specific role to encapsulate the oligonucleotides into aqueous phase. In addition to this, a selection of surfactants can be used to tailor their LNP properties.

Ionizable cationic lipid:

Ionizable cationic lipids are lipids that are electrically neutral at neutral pH, but that switch to positively charged below their acid-dissociation constant (pKa). As described above, they serve 3 functions: when positively charged, they allow for a more efficient encapsulation process of the nucleic acid during the fabrication and a better delivery in the cytosol. When neutral at neutral pH, they permit lowered nanoparticle toxicity for the body.

Ionizable lipids are the highest proportion of all the lipids presents in the LNP with typically 50 mol%, as they are needed to both bind and encapsulation the oligonucleotides cargos. They therefore are the main component of the inner core of the LNP and serve to trap the nucleic acid inside vesicles. Some ionizable lipids also take part to the membranes, which when they change of charge in the cytosol leads to its structural disruption of the LNP and the cargo delivery to the cell.

## PEG-lipid:

Despite being the smallest %age of all the lipids composing the LNP, the PEG lipid has a major impact on several key characteristics of the LNP including size, aggregation, and stability, encapsulation efficiency… All these properties are related to both the molar ratio of the PEG, and the length of the lipid tail and PEG chain.

Studies show that even in small concentrations PEG highly helps with the size control of the LNP population, which can increase to 200 nm with 0% PEG, instead of 100nm with as low as 0.5 mol%.

PEG also appears to help prolong circulation time by minimizing liver uptake and therefore helps increase the overall drug delivery efficiency in the body.

## Phospholipids:

Phospholipids were the major components of the original lipid-based nanoparticles from which the LNP is derived and that contained nearly 85 mol% of it.  Since then, its role and %mol has decreased in favor of the ionizable lipids. The current commercial LNP formulation contains around 10% of phospholipids, generally in the form of DSPC. Mostly present in the membrane, phospholipids mostly help improve encapsulating efficiency.

## Sterol lipids

The sterol lipids -generally cholesterol - are helper lipids, and their role mostly depends on the compound they are associated with. When combined with phospholipids helps with the rigidity and stability of the membrane and pushes the lipids toward a liquid-ordered phase. Thanks to this, sterols facilitate stable encapsulation, help decrease drug leakage, and greatly improve drug stability over time.

## Lipid nanoparticles synthesis methods:

Wide varieties of methods are available for the synthesis of lipid nanoparticles, each offering a different trade-off in terms of the characteristics of the generated LNPs, and encapsulation efficiency and scale-up capabilities.

Three main categories of methods can be defined: The high energies methods, the low energy methods, and the solvent-based methods.

The pros and cons of each method are summarized in the below table

## High energy methods

High-energy methods such as HPH and sonication are using the high energy provided by the system to break down the particles into smaller ones. Their main advantage is to already be available and easily scalable. However, they provide very poor control of the generated lipid nanoparticles and

## Low energy process

Low-energy methods such as microemulsion are based on the injection of a surfactant into the system to decrease the nanoparticle size. They are relatively easy to use yet offer poor size control and average encapsulation efficiency. In addition to this, the high quantity of surfactant used in the process leads to potential toxicity and is thus to be avoided.

## Solvent-based methods

Solvent-based methods are characterized by using a solvent (usually ethanol) to dissolve the lipids before mixing it with the drug or oligonucleotide to self-generate the lipid nanoparticles. They can be divided into 2 subclasses: Solvent evaporation and microfluidics-based methods. Solvent evaporation methods such as thin film evaporation leverage solvent extraction to synthesize the LNP. Instead, microfluidics relies on the fine control of the mixing parameters at a low scale to accurately control the parameters of the synthesized lipid nanoparticles while offering optimal encapsulation efficiency.

## Lipid nanoparticle characterization

As described above, the physiochemical attributes of the lipid nanoparticles need to be precisely controlled throughout their synthesis process to reach the targeted area and efficiently deliver their payload to the cells.

While there is currently no regulatory framework for nanomedicines set by the European Medicine Agency (EMA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) a set of general guidelines is available as requires a thorough characterization of the lipid nanoparticles throughout the process.

The most critical parameters are the physiochemical parameters such as LNP size and size distribution (characterized by the polydispersity index or PDI), morphology as well as their Zeta potential. Drug loading and encapsulation efficiency are also important parameters to be considered to characterize the overall LNP encapsulation process.

## Lipid nanoparticle Size and distribution

LNP size has a huge impact on its ability to penetrate and efficiently deliver its payload to the cells. Small lipid nanoparticles offer the advantage of easily penetrating the cells. Nevertheless, when too small, the cells tend to have difficulties expelling them, leading to toxicity. The optimal LNP size varies depending on the application. A general compromise is to use LNP of a size around 100 nm for cell uptake, while LNP in the 50nm range is preferred for tumor extravasation.

The PDI is a dimensionless parameter, with values ranging from 0 to 1, 0 being homogeneous, and 1 being heterogeneous, that helps give information on the spread of LNP size in the sample. The FDA guidelines suggest using a PDI below 0.3. To be sure to fall within those requirements, a PDI below 0.2 is generally preferred.

Size and PDI characterized are generally achieved using optical methods such as dynamic light scattering (DLS) or laser diffraction (LD).

## Lipid nanoparticle Zeta potential

The Zeta potential is a measure of the magnitude of the electrostatic charge at the surface of the LNP.

A too-neutral LNP (low Zeta potential) will lead to an increased LNP aggregation during the production process, as the charge will not repel each other. On the other hand, a too-high charge at the surface of the LNP will lead to toxicity as described previously. For this reason, a zeta potential in the order of -30 mV is generally considered optimal for the LNP.

Zeta potential is characterized using a Zeta Potential Analyzer

## LNP surface morphology

Microscopy methods such as Transmission electron microscopy (TEM or Cryo-TEM) or Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) are generally used to characterize the lipid nanoparticle morphology, each offering a different compromise. AFM allows for a 3D mapping of the lipid nanoparticle, while TEM offers a view of the internal composition of the LNP.

## Load capacity (DL) and Encapsulation Efficiency (EE%) for LNP

Load capacity and encapsulation efficiency characterize the LNP's ability to efficiently encapsulate the oligonucleotide.

The Load capacity corresponds to the percentage of trapped API over the total LNP weight. Instead, the encapsulation efficiency measures the percentage of oligonucleotides that were successfully encapsulated throughout the manufacturing process (i.e trapped nucleotides over the initial amount in the formulation).

The most effective synthesis process -such as microfluidics - manages to reach an encapsulation efficiency above 90%

## Lipid nanoparticle delivery mechanism:

When introduced to the body, RNA and small molecules are overall unstable and prone to degradation by the serum endonucleases.

Historically, gene therapies were delivered using viral formulations, where viruses are used to deliver nucleic acids to the cells. While mastered, those methods are not optimal as they still show multiple side effects (strong immune responses, hepatotoxicity...) and only have a small loading capacity (~5kilobases).

As described in the review on lipid-based nanoparticles, in the past 50 years liposomes and other types of lipid-based nanoparticles have extensively been used for drug and small particle delivery. However, their simpler structure does not allow for efficient nucleic acid encapsulation and delivery to their target cell.

For all these reasons, the development of LNP optimized for oligonucleotides' transport opened new possibilities for the treatment of a wide range of diseases through the delivery of genetic material to the cells.

A great variety of payloads can be efficiently encapsulated and delivered to the target cells using LNP. Lipid nanoparticles not only allow for the delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics, such as messenger RNA (mRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), and small activating RNA (saRNA) but also small molecules, peptides, proteins, as well as ribonucleoproteins such as Cas9.

## Gene and small molecules delivery with LNP

The initial steps of the intracellular delivery mechanism of RNA and small molecules/drug are relatively similar: The improved circulation time of the LNP allows them to enhance their targeted delivery to specific tissues, where they extravasate and accumulate into the interstitial fluid.

At that stage, if the LNP contains small molecules/drugs, it will simply release the drug over time, which will diffuse across the target cell. If they are targeted via ligands against the cell, LNPs can cross the target cell membrane and lead to the release of the drug within the cell itself.

When containing nucleic acid, LNP 's ligands' attachment against the cell surface receptor leads to an endocytotic LNP uptake. The decrease of pH during the maturation process of the endosome leads to a change of charge of the ionizable lipid, destabilizing the LNP structure which then releases the nucleic acid into the cytoplasm.

As introduced in the figure above, the next steps of the process will then depend on the type of RNA encapsulated: mRNA will be translated into proteins by the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. SiRNA will combine with other proteins to form a RISC complex, which will bind with a complementary mRNA, inducing its cleavage.

For CRISPR, both the guide RNA and the Cas9 protein are encapsulated and delivered to the cell, following then a standard CRISPR process.

## LNP functionalization

In the previous step, we have described how LNP manages to efficiently release its encapsulated material within the cell. However, an efficient drug not only requires efficient delivery of material, but also requires the delivery of the right amount of drug/RNA at the right location.

2 main strategies can be used for targeting: active and passive targeting.

## LNP passive targeting

Passive targeting relies on the accumulation of nanoparticles in lesions.

In the example of tumor cells, the worsened vascularization of the tumor leads to a longer retention time within the tumor itself, leading to more extravasation and thus accumulation of the lipid

Lipid Nanoparticle Systems for Enabling Gene Therapies

## Lipid nanoparticle active targeting

Active targeting relies on the functionalization of the LNP by a ligand to bind to a specific surface. Those targeting ligands located on the surface of the LNP can recognize specific receptors on disease cells, and pathogens… and conjugate with them.

The decoration of lipid nanoparticles can be achieved either by the mean of targeting peptides, but also carbohydrate ligands, or even antibodies. This permits a very specific interaction with the tissues, and thus precise delivery of the payload to the cells.

## Active targeting assembly methods

There exist 2 main methods to fabricate functionalized lipid nanoparticles.

The first one called One-pot assembly requires a pre-step where the target ligand is bonded to one of the lipids, which is then used to prepare the LNP using the standard process described in the synthesis method section. Though easy to use, this process shows 2 major drawbacks as most of the ligand can get trapped within the LNP and not at its surface, making it much less efficient. Also, ligands being very fragile, they can very easily be altered during the production process.

Considering those limitations, ligands are usually post-inserted to the LNP after their synthesizes. In this context, LNP are coated with a lipid with a functional group, which is then put in contact and binds with a targeting ligand. This has the advantage of having the ligands only located on the surface of the LNP, but requires a more complex synthesis process.

## Lipid nanoparticles applications

Thanks to their unique properties, Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as versatile and promising delivery vehicles in a wide variety of fields. Their improved biodistribution compared to other delivery mechanism and their ability to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs within their lipid bilayers, or RNA/hydrophilic compounds in their aqueous core, makes LNPs an attractive choice for various applications.

## mRNA Vaccines

mRNA vaccines work by using an LNP to introduce an mRNA strand that codes for a specific protein, usually a protein of the target virus surface, directly into the cell cytoplasm. While in the cytoplasm, the mRNA will be translated by ribosomes to produce the viral protein it codes for. The immune system will then learn how to recognize this foreign protein and produce the corresponding antibodies.

## Gene therapy

Gene therapy aims at producing a therapeutics effect by manipulating gene expression to alter the biological properties of a cell. In this specific context, LNP are used to deliver some types of noncoding RNA, such as siRNA , miRNA… that will modify the gene expression within the cell. For instance, siRNA will prevent specific gene expression by degrading its complementary mRNA, preventing translation.

## Drug delivery

In addition to ARN delivery, LNPs have garnered substantial attention in pharmaceuticals for their ability to encapsulate and deliver drugs, especially for cancer therapies. They are particularly useful for poorly water-soluble drugs, enhancing their solubility, stability, and ultimately, their therapeutic efficacy. LNPs protect drugs from degradation, improve their bioavailability, notably through the EPR effect making it a good fit for tumor targeting, and allow for controlled release, leading to more effective treatments and reduced side effects.

## Personalized medicine

The tunable nature of LNPs allows for surface modification with ligands or antibodies that can target specific cells or tissues. This makes LNPs a valuable tool in the development of personalized medicine approaches, tailoring treatments to individual patients' needs.

## Agriculture

Lipid nanoparticles can also be used outside medicine. In the context of agriculture, LNPs are used to deliver agrochemicals directly within plants. Their small size and versatile surface modification enable them to penetrate plant tissues more effectively, reducing environmental impact and increasing the efficiency of agrochemical applications.

## From liposomes to LNPs

As its offspring, lipid nanoparticles exhibit very similar characteristics to liposomes, though with one major change making it use: the use of a ionizable lipid.

One main limitation to the current liposomes is the poor interaction with nucleic acid due to their neutral change. For this reason, cationic lipids were used to help with the interaction of negatively charged RNA, leading to improved encapsulation efficiency. However, the use of regular cationic lipids also leads to an increase LNPs toxicity by triggering an immune response and cytotoxicity, thus not being a viable solution.

The pros and cons of each method are summarized in the below table, and more details about them can be found in our LNP manufactuing review.

Comparison of the lipid nanoparticules manufacturing process

## High energy

Their main advantage is to already be available and easily scalable. However, they provide very poor control of the generated lipid nanoparticles and show very low encapsulation efficiency.

Passive targeting relies on the accumulation of nanoparticles in lesions.

In the example of tumor cells, the enhanced vascularization of the tumor leads to a longer retention time within the tumor itself, leading to more extravasation and thus accumulation of the lipid nanoparticle at the location. This process has been widely studied and is known as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, not all types of diseases show this effect, which can also vary from model to model.

## Lipid nanoparticles active targeting

Active targeting relies on the functionnalization of the LNP by a ligand to bind to a specific surface. Those targeting ligands located on the surface of the LNP can recognize specific receptors on disease cells, and pathogens… and conjugate with them.

## Lipid nanoparticles applications

Thanks to their unique properties, Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as versatile and promising delivery vehicles in a wide variety of fields. Their improved biodistribution compared to other delivery mechanism and their ability to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs within their lipid bilayers, or RNA/hydrophilic compounds in their aqueous core, makes LNPs an attractive choice for various applications.

## mRNA Vaccines

mRNA vaccines work by using an LNP to introduce an mRNA strand that codes for a specific protein, usually a protein of the target virus surface, directly into the cell cytoplasm. While in the cytoplasm, the mRNA will be translated by ribosomes to produce the viral protein it codes for. The immune system will then learn how to recognize this foreign protein and produce the corresponding antibodies.

## Gene therapy

Gene therapy aims at producing a therapeutics effect by manipulating gene expression to alter the biological properties of a cell. In this specific context, LNP are used to deliver some types of noncoding RNA, such as siRNA, miRNA… that will modify the gene expression within the cell. For instance, siRNA will prevent specific gene expression by degrading its complementary mRNA, preventing translation.

## Drug delivery

In addition to ARN delivery, LNPs have garnered substantial attention in the pharmaceutical industry for their ability to encapsulate and deliver drugs, especially for cancer therapies. They are particularly useful for poorly water-soluble drugs, enhancing their solubility, stability, and ultimately, their therapeutic efficacy. LNPs protect drugs from degradation, improve their bioavailability, notably through the EPR effect making it a good fit for tumor targeting, and allow for controlled release, leading to more effective treatments and reduced side effects.

## Personalized medicine

The tunable nature of LNPs allows for surface modification with ligands or antibodies that can target specific cells or tissues. This makes LNPs a valuable tool in the development of personalized medicine approaches, tailoring treatments to individual patients' needs.

## Agriculture

Lipid nanoparticles can also be used outside medicine. In the context of agriculture, LNPs are used to deliver agrochemicals directly within plants. Their small size and versatile surface modification enable them to penetrate plant tissues more effectively, reducing environmental impact and increasing the efficiency of agrochemical applications.
